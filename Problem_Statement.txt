Given an expression string exp. Examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp.
For example, the program should print 'balanced' for exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” and 'not balanced' for exp = “[(])”

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.  Each test case consists of a string of expression, in a separate line.

Output:
Print 'balanced' without quotes if the pair of parenthesis is balanced else print 'not balanced' in a separate line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105

Example:
Input:
3
{([])}
()
([]

Output:
